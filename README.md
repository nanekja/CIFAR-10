# CIFAR-10
Various experimentation on CIFAR-10 dataset


## Classifying images of everyday objects
In this repository, several approaches has been experimented on CIFAR-10 dataset using Pytorch. During this I will explore the CIFAR-10 dataset in : https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.
